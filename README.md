# time-series
Time series Analysis deals with the time dependence of different variables and hence, becomes a useful tool in analysis and predictive modelling. The analysis comes with the knowledge of statistics, signal processing as well as data extraction and manufacturing.

This repository tries to serve the above purposes where each notebook comes up with time series topics along with visualisation using Python's wide range of libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly.
